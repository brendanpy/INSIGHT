# INSIGHT Additional Resources

INSIGHT (INtelligence in-SItu printing Guided by Eye-in Hand robot Technology), is an autonomous robotic system leveraging multiple state of the art components for usage in surgical/medical operations.

## Hardware Dependencies

- EPSON VT6L 
- WAGO PLC
- Intel Realsense Camera 

## Software Dependencies

All programming is done in Python. Communicating with external hardware is also done using Python and libraries. Third party libraries dependencies include. 
-Numpy 
-pyrealsense2
-OpenCV
-Sympy
-Shapely
-Pandas
-Open3D
-Alphashape
-Descartes
-matplotlib

Libraries to communicate with the robot and WAGO PLC system were developed by the software team and will be available in the repository. 

## Installation Guide 

In order to utilize the code, all software dependencies must be installed. The robot needs to be directly connected to the computer via ethernet cable for communication to be established.
